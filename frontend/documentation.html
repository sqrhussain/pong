<h2>Topic</h2>
  <p class="documentation">
Multiplayer Pong Game
  </p>
  <h2>Description</h2>
    <p class="documentation">
        We implemented the early arcade game “pong” with web technologies, to play in the browser. Instead of local
        multiplayer like the original game, we are to be capable of online multiplayer from one web browser versus
        another web browser, connected via a server. It is also possible to look up your current highscore after
        playing the game, connected with your username.
    </p>
  <h3>Application Technologies</h3>
      <p class="documentation">
          The main technology in use will be HTML5 with javascript on the client side, following the MVC pattern.

 In order to serve this frontend code we need a very basic web server. To display our game graphics we used canvas.
          As for the storage technology we used Web Storage to save the username.
Multiplayer communication will be done over WebSockets, for this we implemented a server that takes care of relaying
          information between browsers, probably in python 3.
We used two two HTML5 features on our website: Audio(several times over the website) and Web forms with placeholder
          (on the start page for the playername)

      </p>
        <button id="PongButton" class="float-left submit-button" >Go Back to Pong!</button>
<script>
           document.getElementById("PongButton").onclick = function () {
       location.href = "index.html";
        };
        </script>
    </body>
</html>
